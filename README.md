# Dotfiles
My configuration files used by Unix-based systems to customize various software which used on my daily life.

# Installation
Run `install.sh` under directory to install all the require software and configs at once.
```sh
./install.sh
```
The script will install i3wm, mise, some fonts, some configs, etc...
Before installation, please read the script.
And confirm those are all you need. Feel free to modify.

The script will run smooth on Arch and Ubuntu, other distro are not guarantee.
